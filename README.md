# GSBaseMVVM
**GSBaseMVVM is a base project which follows MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) coding pattern.**

## What is MVVM?

###### The Model-View-ViewModel concept describes 3 components:
- Model: a wrapper of data
- View: a representation of a user interface (UI), it is a combination of view & viewcontroller
- ViewModel: an intermediary between the Model and the View

###### How the messages can flow from one component to the other:
- The View/view controller presents Model data to the user 
- The View/view controller does not talk directly to the Model. The View/view controller can only talk to the Model indirectly through the ViewModel.
- The ViewModel is the intermediary between the View/view controller and Model.


## Why to use MVVM?
- MVVM provides better Encapsulation
- Improved Testability
- Debugging becomes easier
- Easier to create unit tests as the main business logic would be written in the ViewModel only
- Reduce overhead of viewcontroller

## Key Features:
- Basic MVVM Architecture
- Simple TableView
- API Calling Structure

## How to run the project?

- Make sure you have an active internet connection and connected with a Physical device or you can use Xcode Simulator too.
- download or clone the project
- Open the terminal
- cd (project_path)
- pod install
- Open .xcworkspace file from your project folder
- Run the project from Xcode
